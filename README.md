About Dataset
The data provides a trend in minimum temperatures of the states considered (Kogi and Abuja in Nigeria) on a monthly basis for the past three decades.

Project Overview
Running the program
You can open 'Abj_T(min)_Project.ipynb and Kg_T(min)_Project.ipynb' using Jupyter notebook. To run the program, I use Anaconda's Jupyter notebook on a Windows 10 machine.

Program Details
Requirements *Language: Python 3.6 or above *Libraries: arima, pandas, numpy, time *platform: Jupyter notebook
